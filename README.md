## Introduction

This is the repository associated with the article series where we learn about Next.js and Django. 
We use both of them together to build a reactive blog with a modern user interface. The [article]('https://scotch.io/preview/building-a-modern-blog-with-django-and-nextjs-part-1) series aims at demonstrating the implementation of some crucial features in most functional blogs; we begin by learning how to set up the development environment and finally deploy the application. 

## Requirements
* [Python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)
* [Pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/)
* [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/))

## Running the application
1. Clone the project on your computer ```[git clone https://github.com/Jordanirabor/django-next-blog/]```
2. Navigate into the diretory ```[cd django-next-blog]```
3. Navigate into the backend directory ```[cd backend]```
4. Install dependencies ```[pipenv install]```
5. Create a .env file and put in your enviroment variables
6. Start the backend server ```[python run server]```
7. Open a different terminal (from the parent directory of the project) and navigate into the frontend directory ```[cd frontend]```
8. Install dependencies ```[npm install]```
9. Start the development server ```[npm start]```
10. Check out this website on the address - ```[http://localhost:8000]```

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - A programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.
* [Django](http://djangoproject.org/) - A high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
* [Next](https://nextjs.org/) - With Next.js, server rendering React applications has never been easier, no matter where your data is coming from.
